# Code for our submission to Householder Symposium XX

The repository contains two notebooks. One for simulating Kronecker graphs and one for distributed iterative SVD. The easiest way to run the notebooks is to click [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/andreasnoack/hhxx)
. Alternatively, it is also possible link a JuliaBox account to this repository which would make the notebooks available in your JuliaBox. Finally, it is also possible to download and run the notebooks on a local IJulia installation.
